"What is batch fermentation and how does it work?","Batch fermentation is a closed culture system where a limited amount of sterilized nutrient medium is introduced into the fermenter. The medium is inoculated with a suitable microorganism and incubated for a definite period under optimal physiological conditions. Oxygen, antifoam agents, and pH control substances are added during the process. The fermentation runs until nutrients are exhausted, and the product is harvested and separated."

"What are the disadvantages of batch fermentation?","1. Requires cleaning and sterilization for each batch. 2. Only a fraction of the batch cycle is productive. 3. Increased running costs for stock cultures. 4. Frequent sterilization stresses equipment. 5. Non-productive shutdown periods between batches."
"How is batch fermentation used for biomass and metabolite production?","Batch fermentation is used for biomass production under conditions supporting the fastest growth rate. For primary metabolites, the exponential growth phase is prolonged, while for secondary metabolites, it is reduced to optimize yield."
