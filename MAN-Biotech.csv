"What is gel entrapment in cell immobilization?","- Cells are trapped within a gel matrix such as alginate, agarose, polyacrylamide, or carrageenan. 
- The gel provides a protective environment while allowing the diffusion of nutrients and metabolites. 
- Commonly used in bioreactors, wastewater treatment, and probiotic encapsulation. 
- Example: Calcium alginate beads for immobilizing yeast in ethanol production."
"What is cell containment behind a barrier in cell immobilization?","- Cells are physically separated from the surrounding medium using a semipermeable membrane. 
- The membrane prevents cell leakage while allowing substrate and product exchange. 
- This method is used in applications requiring controlled cell growth and activity. 
- Example: Hollow fiber bioreactors used in tissue engineering and bioartificial organs."
"What is encapsulation in cell immobilization?","- Encapsulation is the process of enclosing cells within microspheres or capsules composed of polymers such as alginate, chitosan, or polyethylene glycol (PEG). 
- Encapsulation provides protection against shear forces, toxins, and immune responses. 
- Common in drug delivery systems, probiotics, and artificial cell development. 
- Example: Alginate-polylysine microcapsules for islet cell transplantation in diabetes treatment."
"What is adsorption/adhesion in cell immobilization?","- Cells adhere to surfaces or carriers such as glass, ceramics, or synthetic polymers via electrostatic interactions or covalent bonds. 
- This method is simple, cost-effective, and widely used in biosensors and wastewater treatment. 
- Example: Immobilization of bacteria on activated carbon for bioremediation."
"What is the application of biocatalysts in cell immobilization?","- Cells are immobilized in a way that enhances their catalytic efficiency in biochemical reactions. 
- Often used in enzyme immobilization to improve stability, reusability, and reaction efficiency. 
- Example: Immobilized lactase in dairy processing for lactose-free milk production."
"What is emulsification in encapsulation?","- Emulsification is the process of mixing two or more liquids that normally don't mix together to form a semi-stable mixture."
"What is interfacial polymerization in encapsulation?","- Interfacial polymerization is a method where a polymer membrane forms at the interface of two immiscible liquids."
"What is coacervation in encapsulation?","- Coacervation is a process where a continuous polymeric membrane forms around a liquid core."
"What are the advantages of immobilized cell systems?","- Increased Stability: Immobilized cells are more resistant to environmental changes (pH, temperature, toxins) compared to free cells. 
- Enhanced Reusability: Cells can be reused multiple times, reducing the need for frequent replacement and lowering operational costs. 
- Higher Cell Density: Immobilization allows for higher cell concentration, leading to increased productivity in bioprocesses. 
- Improved Product Purity: The separation of cells from the product is easier, reducing downstream processing costs. 
- Better Control of Reaction Conditions: Cells remain in a fixed location, enabling better control over reaction parameters like substrate concentration and reaction time. 
- Extended Cell Lifespan: Cells experience less shear stress and damage, leading to prolonged activity and lifespan."
"What are examples of industrially important chemicals produced using immobilized cell systems?","- Amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid, lysine) 
- Organic acids (e.g., citric acid, lactic acid) 
- Biofuels (e.g., ethanol) 
- Enzymes (e.g., lipases, proteases) 
- Antibiotics (e.g., penicillin)"
