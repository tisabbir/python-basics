"🛠️ Don’t Fear Deleting Code","Why It's Important: Deleting code can feel like wasted effort, but it's actually part of the learning process.  
Key Insights:  
- Code is transient and will evolve.  
- It's okay to abandon your approach if it's not working.  
- Writing wrong code is a learning experience.  
- Version control systems like Git are crucial.  
Mindset: Embrace the Sunk Cost Fallacy – it's okay to let go of code that no longer serves the purpose."
"🎯 Define the Goal","Clarify Your Objective: Before diving into coding, always define what you are trying to achieve.  
Steps to Follow:  
1. Formulate the desired outcome.  
2. Come up with a hypothesis or solution.  
3. Implement the solution.  
4. Iterate if it doesn't work.  
Tip: Avoid vague statements like 'it doesn't work.' Be specific about what you want to achieve."
"🧑‍💻 Embrace Debugging as Learning","Learning Opportunity: Debugging is not a sign of failure but an opportunity to learn deeply.  
How to Debug Effectively:  
- Start by identifying where the error might be.  
- Formulate a hypothesis about what the code should do.  
- Debug to confirm whether it does what you expect.  
- If not, trace deeper into the code or go upwards in the call stack.  
Tip: Treat debugging as an investigation to uncover the root cause, not a random process."
"👨‍🏫 Find and Follow Mentors","Why It Matters: Learning from experienced developers accelerates growth.  
Actions to Take:  
- Follow mentors online.  
- Read their books, watch their talks, and engage with their content.  
- Some notable mentors: Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Sandi Metz.  
Tip: Lifelong learning is key to staying updated and improving your skills."
"🗣️ Articulate Your Ideas","The Power of Teaching: Explaining your ideas to others helps reinforce your understanding.  
Ways to Share Your Knowledge:  
- Talk to peers, colleagues, or friends.  
- Engage in pair programming or mob programming.  
- Write blogs, start a YouTube channel, or make devlogs.  
Tip: Articulating your thoughts forces you to truly understand and refine them."
"🔑 Learn Fundamentals, Not Frameworks","Core Knowledge: Frameworks come and go, but the fundamentals stay.  
Focus On:  
- Understanding the core principles behind technologies.  
- Avoiding the 'shiny object syndrome' and focusing on deep knowledge.  
Tip: Don’t just follow trends; master the foundational concepts that apply to any framework or tool."
"🌐 Explore Other Paradigms","Broaden Your Horizons: Start with one paradigm, like object-oriented programming, but explore others, such as functional programming.  
Action Plan:  
- Dive into both object-oriented and functional paradigms.  
- Learn from mentors in both areas.  
Tip: Exposure to different programming paradigms will make you a more versatile developer."
